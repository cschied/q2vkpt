This is Quake II game AI project based on 3.21 original source code.
Code was adapted to Q2VKPT engine (see https://github.com/cschied/q2vkpt/ & http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/).

This is not a game mod (skill levels from 0 to 3 is like original - unchanged).

Improvements:
- fixed all functionality of misc actor (now all defined features works fine - limited to grunt skins only).
- unlocked drop/get/spawn weapon blaster,
- unlocked spawn monster makron,
- fixed repeating monster slights when player is dead,
- added new game skill "hell".

Base fixes/changes only in hell mode/skill:
- fixed monster medic thinking before looking for a dead monster,
- monster medic now can kill self and others when dead monster was revived in the same area (before they are stuck both),
- when gibs was revived, now monster isn't in stuck, like it is in other level skills,
- monster mutant do not stop jumping when is in high,
- monster gunner now trying to shot the target too when dying,
- monster supertank now non-stop attacking by rockets,
- for monsters increased health by 25% and 25% more damage,
- monsters have 5x more probability to hit you,
- monsters always shot target when ducking,
- monsters are only angry of you and your friends even hit by themselfs,
- monsters always are trying to shot the target when dying,
- monsters always avenge their ally,
- monsters using only best weapons,
- monster base behavior is standing and fighting but not running like it was,
- melee monsters are much more stronger,
- many monsters improvements and behaviour changed.

Possible improvements:
- switch off monster slight sounds in hell skill.

TODO:
- some monsters like medic have a origin not equal to the world origin (monster "s.origin" is different as really is - eg in map jail3)!,
- lack of path research tech (path trace is not enough if exist hole between positions - eg medic in map jail3),
- some optimalizations required eg search a new target.

Original Q2VKPT project description:

Welcome to Q2VKPT, a Quake II engine with real-time path tracing.  This client
implements fully dynamic illumination without precomputation supporting area
light sources, reflections, soft shadows, and indirect illumination. This
client is a port of our real-time path tracer vkpt and is based on the Quake II
engine Q2PRO.

This client requires a high-end GPU supporting the Vulkan extension
VK_NV_ray_tracing.

Please refer to our project page for more details.
